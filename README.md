# Strategic Sales and Customer Analytics (Adventure Works)

## Project Description

This project provides an in-depth analysis of global retail sales to support data-driven decision-making for the next business year. Using SQL for data analysis and Power BI for interactive visualization, the analysis focuses on identifying high-value customers, evaluating product category profitability, and uncovering operational inefficiencies, particularly those related to product returns. The goal is to translate raw transactional data into actionable business intelligence that informs marketing strategy, inventory optimization, and strategic expansion.

## Data Source(s)

The dataset used in this project represents a global retail network operating across multiple regions, including the United States, Canada, and Australia. It contains detailed transactional and dimensional data covering:

- Customers

- Products, categories, and sub-categories

- Sales transactions (2020–2022)

- Returns data

- Sales territories and regions

The dataset was provided for analytical purposes and structured across multiple relational tables suitable for SQL-based analysis.

## Research Questions

The analysis was guided by the following business-driven questions:

- Which customers generate the highest revenue and should be prioritized for targeted marketing?

- Which product categories and sub-categories contribute most to overall sales performance?

- Which products experience high return volumes, and how do returns impact revenue?

- What strategic actions can improve customer retention, inventory efficiency, and growth?

## Cleaning Procedures

To ensure reliable analysis, the data underwent structured preparation before analysis:

- Removal of duplicate records and validation of key identifiers

- Standardization of date formats and data types

- Verification of relational integrity across tables

- Aggregation of transactional data to customer-, product-, and category-level views

- Creation of business-ready SQL views to simplify downstream analysis and visualization

## Analytical Approach
### Data Analysis (SQL)

SQL was used to transform raw transactional tables into analytical views. Complex joins, aggregations, and filters were applied to compute metrics such as total revenue per customer, category-level performance, and return frequencies. These views served as the foundation for segmentation and trend analysis.

### Data Modeling and Visualization (Power BI)

The SQL views were imported into Power BI to establish a relational data model, serving as the foundation for structured business reporting. This phase focused on translating complex datasets into clear, visual summaries of organizational performance.

- Relational Schema: Designed a robust data model connecting Sales, Products, Customers, and Territories to ensure data integrity across all reports.

- Strategic Reporting: Created targeted visualizations, allowing stakeholders to identify growth opportunities at a glance.

## Key Insights

- A relatively small segment of customers accounted for a disproportionately high share of total revenue.

- Bikes emerged as the highest-revenue product category but also showed notable return activity.

- Several products combined high sales with high return rates, indicating potential quality or expectation mismatches.

## Strategic Recommendations

- High-Value Customer Targeting: Launch loyalty and personalized marketing campaigns focused on top revenue-generating customers.

- Inventory Optimization: Investigate the most-returned products to address quality, sizing, or product description issues.

- Category Focus: Prioritize high-performing categories while auditing low-velocity items occupying inventory space.

## Outcomes

The project delivered a clear analytical roadmap for the next business year. By identifying top customers and high-impact product issues, the analysis enabled more focused marketing outreach, improved inventory decision-making, and data-backed planning.

## Reflections

This project demonstrates the value of combining SQL’s data processing capabilities with Power BI’s visual storytelling. Beyond data cleaning and querying, the analysis emphasizes translating insights into strategic actions that leadership teams can use to drive measurable business outcomes.
